# S3 - infinitely scaling storage

- AWS Main Building Block

- Used by many websites (either as host static websites or store static resources)

- Integrated with many other AWS services

## Buckets & Objects

- globally unique name

- Naming convention
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  - Must start with lowercase letter or number
  
- No directories, but only as a long prefix + /
  - e.g.  s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt 
  
- max 5TB (5000 GB) 

- Encryption for Objects
  - SSE-S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    - **AWS manages both data key and master key**
  - SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys
    - AWS manages data key and **you manage master key** 
  - SSE-C: You manage both data key and master key
  - Client Side Encryption

- expose both HTTP and HTTPs

## Versioning

- why? 
  - protect from unintending delete
  - easy to roll back
  
- enable at bucket level 

## Security

- User based
    - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
      console
- Resource based 
    - Bucket Policies (JSON) - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account

- ACL:
    - ACLs are primarily used to grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts 
    - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
    - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common, e.g. grant public access

- Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
        - the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
        - AND there’s no explicit DENY    

### How to prevent accidental deletion
To avoid accidental deletion in Amazon S3 bucket, you can:

- Enable Versioning

- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete

#### S3 MFA Delete
MFA Delete forces users to use MFA tokens before deleting objects. It's an extra level of security to prevent accidental deletes


### By default, all S3 resources are private.

### Policies

- resource based
- user based
- or combine both

## Consistency Model
- Eventual consistency for PUT and DELETE of existing objects
    - e.g. after delete an object, may still get 200 for a short time
    - PUT 200, may get 404 for new objects, or get 200 for a older version
    
- there is no strong consistency                

## Server Access Logging

- CloudTrail Log + Server Access Logs

You can use AWS CloudTrail logs together with server access logs for Amazon S3. CloudTrail logs provide you with **detailed API tracking** for Amazon S3 bucket-level and object-level operations, 

while server access logs for Amazon S3 provide you visibility into object-level operations on your data in Amazon S3.

- CloudTrail Log + CloudWatch

You can also use CloudTrail logs together with CloudWatch for Amazon S3. 

CloudTrail integration with CloudWatch Logs delivers S3 bucket-level API activity captured by CloudTrail to a CloudWatch log stream in the CloudWatch log group you specify. You can create CloudWatch alarms for monitoring specific API activity and receive email notifications when the specific API activity occurs

- referrer, turnaround time
    - available in Server Access Logs
